            Never been able to visit the seven wonders across the globe? Not to worry! You can now witness all of them in a single go. 
            Seven Wonders Park in Kota comprises of miniatures of all the Seven Wonders of the World. These include Taj Mahal, Great Pyramid, Eiffel Tower, 
            Leaning Tower, Christ the Redeemer of Brazil, Colosseum, and Statue of Liberty. 
            The project which was undertaken to build this garden was worth 20 crores by Urban Development Department. It took more than 150 workers to complete the project.
        </p>
        <blockquote>It has become a famous tourist spot and attracts thousands of visitors from all over the world. 
            These miniatures have been built on the bank of the Kishore Sagar Lake thereby enhancing its beauty.

            Cameras are allowed in the park so that happy moments can be captured. Also, facilities such as food stalls with delicious 
            food at a nominal rate, lockers, and washrooms are offered to the general public. It is best to visit the park in the evening.
